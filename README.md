# ðŸ¤” Learning

This repository is for my journey in learning new skills. The basic premise is that when I practice a technical skill just for the sake of learning it, it's going to go into this repository. This will probably get a little bit out of hand after a while, but let's see how it goes. If I ever need to reorganize, I'll be able to track that here too.
